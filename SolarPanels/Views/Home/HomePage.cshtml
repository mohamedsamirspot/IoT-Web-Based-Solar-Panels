            <h3> 1.	Monocrystalline Silicon  </h3>
            <p> The monocrystalline panels have a uniform appearance which indicates the purity of silicon crystals. Monobloc cells are silicon ingots cut into strips and you can see that the letters of the cells are not contiguous, and this gives the single plates their distinctive appearance as shown in the picture. These panels are the most expensive species.</p>

            <p>
                The difference between them and monochrome is very clear in terms of form in the two images, where the cells are squares.
                Characterized by a lower price compared to monocytes. Its efficiency is about 16.9% Its shelf life is 25 years or more.

            <p>
                This type of solar panel is thin and streamlined as shown in the picture and takes the shape of the surface on which it is installed
                Most of the developments and research currently underway are based on development in this type because it has a streamlined weight and low thickness.

            <h2>Solar panel reliability</h2>
            <p>when the sunlight falls on the cell, this light passes through the surface of the cell and absorbs part of it by the first layer of the cell, which contains the phosphorus, but the majority of light falling on this cell is absorbed by the part of the layer that contains the silicone In which the process consists of free-motion electrons that can flow through the electrical conductor at the ends of the cell and increase this movement by increasing the intensity of the light falling on this cell. From here we can connect an electric load to the ends of this cell and benefit from the movement of electrons resulting from the shed Light of the sun on the cell.</p>
